# Data-Analysis-Projects

Hi there, and welcome to my GitHub! 
Here you'll find a collection of data analysis projects that I've worked on. I focus on transforming raw data into meaningful insights, and each project 
showcases a different aspect of the process—from cleaning and exploring data to building models and visualizing results. 

Feel free to take a look, and if you have any questions or want to chat about the work, don’t hesitate to reach out!
